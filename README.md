# Ratistics - Ruby Statistics Gem

Ratistics provides basic statistical computation functions
to Ruby programmers. It is intended for small data sets only.
This gem was designed for simplicity. Very little consideration
was given to performance.

## Genesis

This gem started out as an exercise while reading the excellent
book *Think Stats* by Allen B. Downey. None of his Python source
code was used in this gem, it was only used to check my results.
For more information please see
[the author's web site](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats/).

## Test Data

The test data shipped with this gem is freely available from
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
[National Survey of Family Growth](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg.htm).
It is the test data used in the aforementioned book *Think Stats*.
